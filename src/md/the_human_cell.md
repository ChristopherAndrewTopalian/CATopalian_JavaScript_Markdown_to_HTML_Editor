It is a self-organizing, information-processing structure.

---

## Key Features

- Contains **DNA**, which stores information at densities of up to *1 exabyte per cubic millimeter*.  
- Powered by *mitochondria*, the energy factories of the cell.  
- Communicates using *chemical signals* and electrical pathways.  
- Repairs and maintains itself while performing specialized functions.

## Why It Is Astonishing

1. Each cell contains an entire blueprint for the human body.  
2. The DNA in a single cell, if stretched out, is about *2 meters long*.
